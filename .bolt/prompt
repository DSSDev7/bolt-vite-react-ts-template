For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.

CRITICAL - Route Tracking:
Whenever you create, modify, or delete routes/pages in this React application, you MUST maintain a routes.json file in the project root with the following format:

{
  "routes": [
    {"path": "/", "name": "Home", "component": "src/App.tsx"},
    {"path": "/about", "name": "About", "component": "src/pages/About.tsx"}
  ]
}

- Include ALL routes defined in your React Router configuration
- Use exact route paths as they appear in your code
- Use user-friendly display names (e.g., "Home" not "HomePage" or "home-page")
- Update this file EVERY time you add, remove, or rename a route
- This enables the preview UI to show a dropdown of all available pages
